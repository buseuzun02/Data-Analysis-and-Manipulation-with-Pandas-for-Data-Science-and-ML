# Data Analysis and Manipulation with Pandas for Data Science and ML

This project demonstrates the practical use of **Pandas**, a core Python library for data manipulation and analysis, in data science and machine learning workflows. It provides hands-on examples for efficiently handling structured datasets.

## Key Features
- **Data Loading & Exporting:** Read/write CSV, Excel, and other data formats.  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and type conversions.  
- **Data Transformation & Aggregation:** Filtering, grouping, pivoting, and merging datasets.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Descriptive statistics, correlations, and summary insights.  
- **Practical Examples:** Applied on real-world datasets to prepare data for analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Purpose
Designed for both beginners and practitioners, this project illustrates how to leverage **Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis**, forming a strong foundation for data science, ML, and reporting in Python.
